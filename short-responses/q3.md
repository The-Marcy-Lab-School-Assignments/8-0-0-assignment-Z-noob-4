# Question

`app.get(endpoint, controller)` takes in a `controller` as the second argument.

What is a controller?

# Answer
Controllers are components in server-side applications that manage the logic behind each endpoint, deciding how the server should handle requests and may ~~interacting~~ interact with databases, ~~processing~~ process data, and then ~~sens~~ send responses to clients.

# Teacher Feedback

Controllers are not components, they are functions.
